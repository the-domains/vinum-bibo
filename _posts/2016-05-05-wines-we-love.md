# Domaine Eden 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon

## Rocky Soils and Rock Steady Cabs

The drought is proving to produce some really stunning wines from the usual suspects in the Santa Cruz Mountain Appellation. It's an exciting time to try almost any bottle from the area. We received our Spring 2016 shipment from the Domaine Eden Winery that included this 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon. This estate grown bottle reminded us of the estate grapes of nearby wineries as well (and it's fun to compare - particularly when good wineries with estate vineyards are so close to one another).

Critical acclaim for this wine and tasting notes include:

* 92 Vinous / Antonio Galloni  
_-"Domaine Eden's Cabernet Sauvignon remains one of the real undiscovered gems in California. Plump, juicy and exuberant, the 2012 offers gorgeous breath and intensity throughout. Red-fleshed fruit, sweet spices, mocha and flowers are all pushed forward. The interplay of expressive, pliant fruit and classic structure is compelling. Readers can look forward to another decade or so of fine drinking."_
